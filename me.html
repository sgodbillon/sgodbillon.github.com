<p>
	I've been working as a software architect at <strong><a href="http://zenexity.com">Zenexity</a></strong> since 2008, in Paris, France, where I live. I studied at <a href="http://www.dauphine.fr">Université Paris Dauphine</a> where I got a master degree in computer science.<p>
<p>
	I am fond of Web technologies, both client and server side. I am a Scala fan (and more generally, of the functional paradigm). My aim is to build well designed, reactive applications, by writing expressive and robust code.
</p>
<p>
	I work on some projects on my own, like <a href="https://github.com/zenexity/AsyncMongo">ReactiveMongo</a> (a non-blocking Scala driver for MongoDB), <a href="https://github.com/sgodbillon/BytecodeParser">BytecodeParser</a> (a Java library to make bytecode parsing and manipulation easier), or <a href="https://github.com/sgodbillon/BetterLogs">Betterlogs</a> (a Play plugin to produce richer logs).
	I am also contributing actively to some open source projects, like <a href="http://www.playframework.org">Play! Framework</a>.
</p>
<p>
	I co-organize the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Paris-MongoDB-User-Group/">MongoDB Paris User Group</a>. If you like MongoDB, or are curious about it, I'd be glad to see you at the next meetup!
